# Troubleshooting
* **Dependency Issue Troubleshooting**
  * Directly modify the current version of depenency.
  * Try to upgrade the version of parent dependency instead.
* **Online Issue Troubleshooting**
  * Use local data to reproduce the error.

## Business Log Type
* **Validation Log**

    Use this log to provide evidence that your feature is working as intended.
    
    If a failure occurs in subsequent business logic, this log can verify your feature’s correctness and help prevent unnecessary troubleshooting.

    Capturing relevant data as evidence is especially important in production, where online errors are often difficult to reproduce.

    Example: 
    ```java
    log.info("Parsed data successfully. ID: {}", id);
    ```
* **Critical Log**

    A critical error has occurred that typically requires terminating the entire workflow.  
    Clearly explain why the process is being interrupted and include relevant data for investigation.

    Example: 
    ```java
    log.error("Workflow interrupted: failed to process data. ID: {}", id);
    ```
* **Warning Log**

    Indicates an issue in your feature that does not affect the overall workflow and it's safe to continue execution.

    If the issue could potentially impact downstream logic, ensure proper handling is implemented.

    Example: 
    ```java
    log.warn("Skipping process due to missing parameter. age: {}", age);
    ```
* **Debug Log**

    Intended for local development and troubleshooting.

    Use these logs to assist in identifying and reproducing issues when the feature doesn't behave as expected.


    Example: 
    ```java
    log.debug("Current referenced name: {}", name);
    ```

### Examples
#### java.util.Calendar
![aejuc1.png](assets/SystemDesign/aejuc1.png)
```text
 * <p>
 * Like other locale-sensitive classes, {@code Calendar} provides a
 * class method, {@code getInstance}, for getting a generally useful
 * object of this type. {@code Calendar}'s {@code getInstance} method
 * returns a {@code Calendar} object whose
 * calendar fields have been initialized with the current date and time:
 * <blockquote>
 * <pre>
 *     Calendar rightNow = Calendar.getInstance();
 * </pre>
 * </blockquote>
